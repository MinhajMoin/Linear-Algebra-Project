# Linear-Algebra-Project
Creating the illusion of 3D without using a graphics library. Application of Concepts of Parallel Projection and Rotation Matrices that I learnt in my Linear Algebra Course taken in the fifth semester of my Bachelors at Habib University.

## Compiling
This uses and has been tested only on MinGW. Make relevant changes to the Makefile to include your SDL Libraries, then type '''mingw32-make.exe''' to compile.
